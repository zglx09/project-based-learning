There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Which NYC schools have the best math results?\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= (800*0.8)].loc[:, [\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(by=\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\nschools_sort = schools.sort_values(by=\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\ntop_10_schools = schools_sort[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]]\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\nagg = schools.groupby(\"borough\").agg({\"school_name\":'count', \"total_SAT\":['mean', 'std']}).round(decimals=2).reset_index()\nagg.columns = [\"borough\", \"count\", \"mean\", \"std\"]\nlargest_std_dev = agg.rename(columns={\"count\":\"num_schools\", \"mean\":\"average_SAT\", \"std\":\"std_SAT\"}).sort_values(by=\"std_SAT\", ascending=False).head(n=1)\nprint(largest_std_dev)                                \n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":30,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Which NYC schools have the best math results?\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= (800*0.8)].loc[:, [\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(by=\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\nschools_sort = schools.sort_values(by=\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\ntop_10_schools = schools_sort[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]]\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\nagg = schools.groupby(\"borough\").agg({\"school_name\":'count', \"total_SAT\":['mean', 'std']}).round(decimals=2).reset_index()\nagg.columns = [\"borough\", \"count\", \"mean\", \"std\"]\nlargest_std_dev = agg.rename(columns={\"count\":\"num_schools\", \"mean\":\"average_SAT\", \"std\":\"std_SAT\"}).sort_values(by=\"std_SAT\", ascending=False).head(n=1)\nprint(largest_std_dev)                                \n\n\n","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1718109688094,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":59,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"cb15372c-0537-44f2-ab71-055f36c557a2","visualizeDataframe":false,"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"     borough  num_schools  average_SAT  std_SAT\n2  Manhattan           89      1340.13   230.29\n"}]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
